					<h2>Privacy statement careers</h2>
					<p class="intro">As part of any recruitment process, Metrological collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. Our privacy statement aims to explain in a simple and transparent way the data we gather and how we process it.</p>

					<h4>What do we do with the information that you have provided with us?</h4>
					<p>We will solely use your personal information for legal grounds and legitimate interests. Once you have applied for a job, we will collect, use and store personal data from you in connection with the recruitment and the hiring process, such as checking whether you have the right qualifications for the job.</p>
					<p>After a conditional job offer has been made to the job applicant, Metrological may use your personal data to conduct a background check as part of its procedures for employment or engagement. It is important to note that we do not process any sensitive personal information, such as your religious or political beliefs, race and criminal history unless it is strictly necessary and it’s legally required.</p>

					<h4>Which personal data do we process for the abovementioned purposes?</h4>
					<p>We process personal data such as:
						<ul>
							<li>your name, street address, telephone number and email address and other contact details</li>
							<li>your competences, skills, experience and educations. This includes your resume, previous employments, educational details, qualifications and third party references.</li>
							<li>Correspondence with Metrological, with regard to job applicants and internships.</li>
							<li>Other information, such as information found from public sources as well as information related to credit or background checks, depending on the position you are applying for and where it is necessary for the recruitment process.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4>How long do we retain your personal data for this purposes?</h6>
					<p>We are solely allowed to keep your personal data for as long as it’s still necessary for the purposes we initially required it or if you have provided us with an explicit consent for storing it. Your resume and other personal data that you have provided us will be kept for 4 weeks after the end of the recruitment process, or in case you have given your explicit consent, it will then be kept for 24 months after the end of the recruitment process for the purpose of future vacancies.</p>
					<h4>Recipients of your data</h6>
					<p>We may transfer your personal data to third parties such as governmental agencies and regulators, such as the tax authorities, social insurance carriers and government authorities.</p>

					<h4>Exercise rights under the GDPR</strong></h6>
					<p>You have the right to access your personal data and ask for it to be rectified or deleted at any time.  If you have any questions or concerns relating to the handling of your personal data please contact: <a href="mailto:k.fleming@metrological.com">k.fleming@metrological.com</a></p>
